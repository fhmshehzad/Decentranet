# Decentranet
## Using IPFS and Blockchain to create a Decentralized Internet
##### Decentranet is a combination of three technologies. IPFS, Blockchain and Encryption. With Decentranet we aim to secure data from wireless sensors by creating a network that is immune to attacks that exploit their single point of failure and from any other external threats. Any data uploaded on Decentranet will be encrypted and then distributed among all the nodes. This data will be identified by its cryptographic hash value. That means any modification or change made to the uploaded data will not go unnoticed. In this way we can make wireless sensor networks a much more reliable way of monitoring or collecting data. This project is beneficial for every industry that uses sensors or generates some data such as the military, industrial, agricultural, financial and even the medical sector.

### Goals and Objectives:
The main goals of the project are:

• To successfully create a decentralized internet that could have a number of applications today and in the upcoming future.

• To create a wireless network that is immune to attacks that exploit their single point of failure and to secure the data from any other external threats.

### Areas of Appication:

Decentranet is a service with countless applications. Some of these are listed below:

• Smart Homes: Decentranet can be used to protect metadata of IoT devices. This eliminates the single point of failure problem and gives smart homes a level of security that is unachievable in a client-server architecture.

• Finance Sector: These days cryptocurrency is booming. Everyone is trusting it and no one is questioning its reliability. Because crypto works in such a way that no single entity owns it and anyone can become a part of it, that’s why our banking sector is falling behind and many people are putting a lot of trust in cryptocurrency. What if the banking sector stops using its traditional ways and adapts to this new technology and becomes a decentralized institute. That way if people know that their assets are in their control, the banking sector will again have the trust of the people.

• Decentralized Storage for Medical Records: Hospitals store their patient records locally. This is not safe as the data can be lost or it could lose its credibility. One solution for this is to move to cloud storage. That too is not completely safe and comes with its own threats. Decentranet is a good solution to this problem. Using decentranet, medical records of patients can be stored securely on a decentralized network that will keep them confidential and protect their integrity.

### Tools and Technologies:

• IPFS. InterPlanetary File System is a file storing and sharing system over a distributed network of peers called nodes. It relies on cryptographic hashes that can be stored on a blockchain. 

• Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM is used to create and execute smart contracts. It does so by completely isolating the code from the networks or processes on the host machine. Execution of each instruction has a cost that the system keeps track of. This is called gas and it is calculated in terms of gwei (Gig wei). 1 gwei = 0.000000001 ETH. Amount of gas used increases with the increase in complexity of computations.

• GoLand. GoLand is an IDE by JetBrains for Golang and extended support for JavaScript. It allows the user to write and debug code without any additional plugins and the editor is very user friendly when it comes to reading, writing or testing the code. 

• Truffle. Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

• GoETH. Go Ethereum is an implementation of the Ethereum protocol and is written in Go. It is available as Geth which is a cli used for running Ethereum nodes.

• Dapps. Dapps or decentralized applications are autonomous applications that work inside a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).

• Visual Studio Code/Remix. VS Code is one of the best IDEs/Editors for writing smart contracts in solidity. Similarly Remix is a browser based IDE used to code smart contracts.

• Kovan/Ropsten Testnets. Kovan and Ropsten are test networks that are used to test smart contracts before deployment.

• Metamask. Metamask is a browser extension that offers a cryptocurrency wallet to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. We’ll be using metamask to create “fake” ETH by using the Ropsten faucet. These will be used in the testnet.

• Azure/AWS. Azure and AWS are two cloud services from Microsoft and Amazon respectively. They will be used to test our network.

• Encrypting File System. EFS is a user based encryption technique that can be used to control who can read the file. EFS uses a symmetric encryption algorithm (because of large amounts of data.) such as AES, IDEA, RC6 etc.

• We will be using the Ethereum private chain because it is very expensive to store data on the public Ethereum blockchain. According to Ethereum’s yellow paper it is approximately 20,0000 gas for 256bit/8 bytes (1word). Based on 02/28/2018 gas prices of 4 gwei/gas. 20,000 gas per Transaction of 8 bytes x 4 gwei/gas = 80,000 gwei for 8 bytes. 80,000 gwei for 8 bytes. x 1000 bytes/8 = 10,000,000 gwei/kB = 0.01 Ether. 0.01 Ether/kB x 1000kB = 10 Ether to store a 1Mb at $860/ether = $8600.00. Therefore it would cost $8,600,000.00 to store a 1 GB file on the Ethereum public blockchain.
